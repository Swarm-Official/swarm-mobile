 * Is the indexer on the other end of this connection serving the chain the

 * A light wallet has no peers and no chain of its own: it believes whatever
 * its one indexer tells it. Pointed at the wrong one it will sync someone
 * else's blocks into this wallet's state, show a balance that is not the
 * user's, and — the part that is not recoverable — build and broadcast a
 * payment against the wrong consensus rules. Two SWARM networks make that a
 * live possibility rather than a theoretical one, so the wallet asks before it
 * syncs and before it sends, and refuses rather than guessing.
 *
 * What it checks is what `GetLightdInfo` actually carries: the chain label.
 * The genesis hash is not in that response, so when the caller can supply one
 * — a profile that has launched, and an indexer that reports one — it is
 * compared too, and a mismatch is refused on the same terms. A profile with no
 * genesis is refused outright: it cannot hold any server to anything.
 *
 * Ported from the desktop wallet's `src/utils/serverIdentity.ts`
